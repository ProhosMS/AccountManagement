### Tools
+ Gradle
+ IntelliJ IDEA (student license)
+ [SceneBuilder] (http://gluonhq.com/open-source/scene-builder/)

### Gradle
since I'll be working at LinkedIn and they use gradle quite a bit, I decided why not? :)

Prerequisites: None, gradle will come bundled with project `gradlew`  

+ To build run `./gradlew build`
+ To build IntelliJ Specific files, run `./gradlew idea`
